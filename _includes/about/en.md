### About Us

Welcome to our project!  

We are a group of passionate students from the Department of Computer Science at University College London (UCL). Our team comes from diverse backgrounds, representing different corners of the world, including China, Hong Kong, and Ukraine.  

Our mission is to harness the advancements of AI technology to make music creation and performance accessible to everyone. With invaluable support from UCL, we aim to empower individuals who face physical challenges, such as quadriplegia or other disabilities, to explore and create music. AI has the potential to unlock opportunities for people who were once unable to experience the joy of playing or composing music, and we are thrilled to play a part in making this possible.  

We are committed to keeping you updated on our progress through regular blog posts on this platform.
